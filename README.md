This is KARO, the Kubernetes Agentic Runtime Operator. Some random changes. Some more changes. Some more changes 2.


# Karo Repository Structure

## Agent and Client-Facing Directories

These directories contain the code and examples that an end-user (like an Agent Developer) would interact with.

- `agentic-sandbox-client/`: Contains the source code for the Python SDK (`sandbox.py`). This is the client library that developers install and use in their agent applications to create and interact with sandboxes.

- `baseline-agent-long-running/`: An example of a complete agent application (the "Kaggle Agent"). It demonstrates how to use the Python SDK (`workflow/kaggle.py` line 69) and serves as a reference implementation for developers.

- `sandbox-runtime/`: The source code for the FastAPI server that runs inside the sandbox pod. This is the image that administrators build and publish. It exposes the /execute and /upload endpoints that the Python SDK calls.

- `examples/`: Contains high-level, user-facing examples of how to use Karo, including sample AgenticSandboxClass and AgenticSandbox CRs and CRDs.

## Operator Code
These directories contain the core Go source code for the Karo operator itself.

- `pkg/controller`: The main Go packages for the operator's logic.Contains the reconciliation logic, including the generic_controller.go and any custom, stateful controllers like agenticsandbox_controller.go.

- `assets/v1`: Contains the embedded Go templates. When you add a new CRD integration, you add its deployment.yaml and service.yaml templates here. These files are bundled directly into the operator binary at build time.

- `transformer/`: Contains the logic for the template engine, which processes the templates from the `assets/` directory. `transform.go` is the important file here. 

- `cmd/`: The main entrypoint for the operator binary (cmd/manager/main.go). This is where the program starts, and the controllers are registered with the manager.


## Build, Deployment, and Configuration
These directories contain the files and scripts needed to build, install, and configure the operator on a Kubernetes cluster.

- `config/`: Holds all the Kubernetes manifests required to deploy and configure the operator. (Note: It might not be up to date since the `install/helm` folder contains the most up to date manifests to deploy the controller)

- `install/`:  Contains the helm chart directory that includes a `crds/` folder to install AgenticSandbox and AgenticSandboxClass CRDs and others. 

- `Dockerfile`: The recipe for building the operator's container image.

- `Makefile`: The main automation tool for the operator. It contains targets for common tasks like make manifests, make docker-build, and make deploy.
